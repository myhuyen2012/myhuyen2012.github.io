        <h1>Photoshoot Effect</h1>
        <p>In this tutorial, we are creating a photot shoot effect with our just-released 
            PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it you can convert a regular div on the page
        into a photo shooting stage simulating a camera-like feel.</p>
        <p>Potential clients want to see who they'll be working with.
            They want to hire people, not stock photography. We produced a custom photo
             shoot to bring the people of Paterson Buchanan front and center and to underscore
             the firm's open and welcoming style. Vivid images illustrate Paterson Buchanan's wife 
             range of clients, as well as their commitment to the picturesque region the firm serves.
